## Short biography
---

I recieved my B.Sc. degree in Eletronics and Computing Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil, in 2016. From 2012 to 2014 I was a undergraduate student at the Laboratory for the Processing of Analog and Digital Signals (PADS) advised by Prof. José Gabriel Rodríguez Carneiro Gomes, where I worked on vector quantization for an CMOS Imager with focal plane compression. I am currently an M.Sc. student in the Eletric Engineering Program (PEE) at UFRJ. I am currently studying deep convolutional neural networks applied to computer vision. Other research interests include generative models, machine learning, and image and signal processing.
