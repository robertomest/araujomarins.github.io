Hi, my name is **Igor Quintanilha** and I'm a master's student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in [Electric Engineering Program](http://www.pee.ufrj.br) of [Instituto Alberto Luiz Coimbra de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa em Engenharia](http://coppe.ufrj.br) (COPPE).

My research interest is in study and application of **deep learning** techniques, specially in *automatic speech recognition*.

I made this blog to share my knowledge that I've been acquiring through my masters, and doing that, I hope I can simplify the process of creating a speaker recognition for others researchers.

Enjoy! :)
